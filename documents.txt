                                        APPARATUS REQUIRED :-
                                                          
                                      Arudino,4 LEDS ,Resistor,wires,Breadboard.

                                 THEORY:-
   
                                     LED are particular type of diode that converts electrical energy into light. 
                                     LED stands for EMMITING DIODE".LEDs are tiny bulbs.However,LEDs requires a lot 
                                     less power. LEDs have two terminals.The positive side of the LEEDis called the
                                      " anode" and is marked by having a longer "lead"leg".
                                    The outer negative side of the LED is called the "cathode".
                                 Currents always flow .the anode to cathode.
                             
                               PROGRAM:-
                               
                            1.   void setup()
                               {
                                 pinMode(10,OUTPUT);
                                 pinMode(9,OUTPUT);
                                 pinMode(8,OUTPUT);
                                 pinMode(7,OUTPUT);
                               }
                                void loop ()
                               {
                                 for (int i=10;i>=7;--i)
                                  {
                                   digitalWrite(i,HIGH);
                                   }
                               }
                          2.    void setup()
                               {
                                 pinMode(10,OUTPUT);
                               }
                                 
                               void main()
                               {
                                 for(int i=10;i>=10;--i)
                                   {
                                     digitalWrite(i,HIGH);
                                     delay(1000);
                                        
                                      digitalWrite(i,LOW);

                           LEARNING AND OBSERVATION :-
                              
                              1. When the brightness is below 50 % then, the 4 LEDs will glows automatically 
                                and when the brightness is 50 %  then only first LED will glow .
                              2. This is very helpful to us.Mainly this is used in the beddroom.
                                                                                                                                    
                                       
                            PRECAUTIONS:-
                                  
                              1. Always ensure the positive terminal of the LEDs is connected to the output pin of the Arduino Uno.
                              2. Before uploading the code to the Arduino Uno.Check the port and board under the tools menu.
                              3. Always ensure that the connections are tightly.
                                 there should not be any loose connections between the port and the 
                                 Arduino and Arduino and the breadboard.
                              4. Always check the LEDs is working or not before connecting to the circuit with the help of multimeter.
                                
                                           
                           RESULT:-

                             Automatic night lamp functioning was verified after uploading the program.
